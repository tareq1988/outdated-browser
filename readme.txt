Show beautiful notice to users using old browsers

== Description ==

So, you're tired of people visiting your modern website with an outdated browser and not doing anything about it. Maybe they aren't "power" users, maybe it's your auntie running a last century browser trying to see awesome CSS3 animations and transforms. Let the user know that’s an outdated browser, and advise them on a better one.

With this solution you can check if the user’s browser can handle your website. If not, it will show a cool looking notice advising the user to update the browser. It'll be up to him/her to decide if he upgrades or not. Don't force the user!

That's it! As simple as it can get.
